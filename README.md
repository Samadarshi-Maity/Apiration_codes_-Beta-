# Apiration_codes_-Beta version

This folder contains a set of code written for my MSc thesis for computing the extent of the deformation of the cellular spheroid.
There are two files for the computation, one is the plotting code set and the other one is the coding set.
The residual plots have also been added along with skewness and the kurtosis to rationalize the good of the visco-elastic models.
